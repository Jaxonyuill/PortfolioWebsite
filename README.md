## About Me

I'm a Full-Time CIT Student at Lethbridge Polytechnic with a passion for technology that began at age 14-16 while managing Minecraft servers with upwards of 30,000 players. This early experience with large-scale community management sparked my love for coding and problem-solving.

My technical approach is generalist - I learn and build what's needed for each solution rather than specializing in one area. This has given me diverse experience across web development, desktop applications, Discord bots, and browser extensions.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy riding my motorcycle and exploring the outdoors, which provides a perfect balance to my technical work.
